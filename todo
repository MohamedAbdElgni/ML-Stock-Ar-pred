# ToDo:
1-Implement model module to train a model for stocks data and returns the predicted values for the next 7 days.
2- optmize the code to be more efficient and faster. 
    a- use multiprocessing to get the data from the API and save it to the database.
    b- use multiprocessing to get the data from the database and train the model.
    c- use multiprocessing to get the data from the database and predict the next 7 days.
    d- use multiprocessing to get the data from the database and save the predicted values to the database.
    e- try to update existing tables instead of downloading the data from scratch.









*Notes:*
    - Total execution time: 161.26258826255798 seconds for getting the data from the API and saving it to the database for 7 stocks .
